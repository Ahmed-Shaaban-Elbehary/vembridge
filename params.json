{"name":"Vembridge","tagline":"C#.NET Library for DSV formats","body":"# Vembridge\r\nVembridge is a general-purpose utility library for reading and writing delimiter-separated values (DSV) with support for internationalization and custom formats.\r\n\r\n## Functionalities\r\n\r\nFunctionalities which are in the progress of being implemented:\r\n* Support common DSV formats - CSV and TXT\r\n* Reading from DSV file and converting to collection of objects\r\n* Writing a collection of objects to DSV files\r\n* Simple utility conversion for primitive data types\r\n* Support for N/A fields in DSV files\r\n* Support for internationalization of number formats and date formats\r\n* Support for configuring mapping between DSV record and typed object\r\n* Integration with .NET LINQ\r\n* Robust error handling and localized error messages\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\n**Reading DSV files**\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nstring path = \"C:\\path\\to\\some_file.csv\";\r\nstring delimiter = \",\";\r\nList<string[]> records;\r\nusing (TextReader textReader = new StreamReader(path))\r\n{\r\n\tStringDsvReader dsvReader = new StringDsvReader(textReader, delimiter);\r\n\trecords = dsvReader.ReadToEnd();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Coming soon**\r\n\r\nThe \"Quick start\" section will soon be updated with examples of how you can set up your custom DSV-object converters for reading and writing, and also how to read/write DSV files with internationalization support.
